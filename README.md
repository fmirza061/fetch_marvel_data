To setup the project 
- After fetching the project from the gitub, run bundle install to set all the dependencies.

- After that fetch the api collection using the postman collection link ("https://www.getpostman.com/collections/e81d4e1e00e10b80d38d ").

- For fetching data i've created services for each operations index.rb and show.rb respectively.

- You might need to create a free account for the api key for that refer to this https://developer.marvel.com/docs and For authentication refer https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/authorization.
